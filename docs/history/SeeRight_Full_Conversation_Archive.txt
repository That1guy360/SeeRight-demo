Project Initialization

Goal: Organize files, validate structure, ensure correct deployment, and
prepare for traction. Files referenced: - SeeRight_OnePager.txt -
SeeRight_Provisional_Draft.txt - SeeRight_package.zip -

Patent Status

-   No patent filed
-   No patent-pending status
-   Defensive disclosure discussed
-   Outreach letters discussed (Google, Android, FDA, EssilorLuxottica)

Strategic Pivot

Shifted focus from legal positioning to traction. Reddit strategy: -
Collect early users - Gather testimonials - Validate engagement -
Present traction instead of idea

MVP Development

Tech stack: - Static HTML - WebGL shader - Sphere input - Before/After
toggle - GitHub Pages deployment

Deployment Issues Resolved

-   404 errors
-   Jekyll conflicts
-   .nojekyll implementation
-   GitHub Actions static deployment
-   index.html folder mistake
-   Shader compile errors
-   Texture flip and mirroring issues
-   Cached texture not redrawing
-   Broken HTML syntax
-   Placeholder early-access link mistake

Chart Rendering Upgrade

-   Removed blurry PNG dependency
-   Implemented 2048x2048 procedural Canvas chart
-   Uploaded to WebGL texture
-   Achieved crisp rendering

Distortion Model

Radial polynomial correction:

vec2 c = uv - 0.5; float r2 = dot(c, c); float k1 = sphere * 0.06; float
k2 = sphere * 0.02; float factor = 1.0 + k1 * r2 + k2 * r2 * r2; uv =
0.5 + c * factor; uv = clamp(uv, 0.002, 0.998);

Added optional blur simulation tied to sphere magnitude.

Business Model Discussed

-   Free tier
-   Premium subscription ($5–$10/month)
-   B2B licensing
-   OEM partnerships

Roadmap

Phase 1: Web MVP (Complete) Phase 2: Cylinder + Axis Phase 3: Android
native build Phase 4: VR integration Phase 5: OEM licensing

Current Status

-   Live demo operational
-   Distortion tuned
-   Procedural crisp chart
-   Early access capture active
-   GitHub Pages stable
